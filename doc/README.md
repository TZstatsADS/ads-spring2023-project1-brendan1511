# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Doc folder

It is quite likely that the teachings of one philosopher can influence another. To investigate connections between philosophers, this project aims to discover who influenced who. We will compare the key topics and phrases used by the various philosophers in the dataset and filter the data based on these findings. From there, if we can find philosophers that seem to have influenced other, then we can look into how their ideologies overlap.

Using semantic similarity, TF IDF, and data visualizations, this project has discovered a pair of philosophers who demonstrate a similarity in ideology, and laid down the framework for doing similar analyses on any pair of authors in the dataset.
